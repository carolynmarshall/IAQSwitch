# IAQSwitch
This is a simple weekend or classroom project to build a switch that can toggle power to an air filter in response to Co2 readings.

Both the [UiFlow](https://flow.m5stack.com/) (Blockly) and generated MicroPython files are included. Could be used for learning about IAQ or early programming/robotics.
